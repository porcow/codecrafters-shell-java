In this stage, you'll implement the =history= builtin.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send multiple commands to your shell, followed by the
=history= command:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello
hello
$ echo world
world
$ invalid_command
invalid_command: command not found
$ history
    1  echo hello
    2  echo world
    3  invalid_command
    4  history
$
#+end_src

The tester expects a history list with the commands that were executed,
formatted and indexed like in the example above.

*** Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes
:END:
- Some shells like /zsh/ don't add the =history= command to the history
  list, but the tester expects it to be present.
