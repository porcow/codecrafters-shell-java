A shell is the program that interprets what you type into the terminal.
It reads your commands, runs programs, and prints their output. Popular
examples are Bash and ZSH.

In this challenge, you'll build your own shell from scratch.

Your shell will run a REPL, parse commands, spawn processes, and more.
