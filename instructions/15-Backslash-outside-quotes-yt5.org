In this stage, you'll implement support for backslashes outside quotes.

*** Backslash Escaping
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: backslash-escaping
:END:
When a backslash =\= is used outside of quotes, it acts as an escape
character. The backslash removes the special meaning of the next
character and treats it as a literal character. After escaping, the
backslash itself is removed.

This works for any character, including: - Characters with special
meaning (like space, ='=, ="=, =$=, =*=, =?=, and other delimiters) -
Characters without special meaning (regular letters like =n=, =t=, etc.)

Here are a few examples illustrating how backslashes behave outside
quotes:

| Command                  | Expected Output | Explanation                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =echo three\ \ \ spaces= | three spaces    | Each   creates a literal space as part of one argument.                                                     |
| echo before  after       | before after    | The backslash preserves the first space literally, but the shell collapses the subsequent unescaped spaces. |
| =echo test\nexample=     | =testnexample=  | =\n= becomes just =n=.                                                                                      |
| =echo hello\\world=      | =hello\world=   | The first backslash escapes the second, and the result is a single literal backslash in the argument.       |
| =echo \'hello\'=         | ='hello'=       | =\'= makes the single quotes literal characters.                                                            |

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
$ ./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send a series of =echo= commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo multiple\ \ \ \ spaces
multiple    spaces
$ echo \'\"literal quotes\"\'
'"literal quotes"'
$ echo ignore\_backslash
ignore_backslash
#+end_src

The tester will check if the =echo= command correctly handles escaped
characters.

Next, the tester will send a =cat= command with backslashes used to
escape characters within filename arguments:

#+begin_src sh
$ cat /tmp/\_ignored_1 /tmp/ignore_\2 /tmp/just_one_\\_3
content1 content2 content3
#+end_src

The tester will verify that the =cat= command correctly accesses these
files.
