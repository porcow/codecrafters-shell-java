In this stage, you'll implement support for appending the command's
standard error to a file.

*** The =2>>= Operator
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-2-operator
:END:
The =2>>= operator appends the standard error of a command to a file.
Unlike =2>=, which overwrites the file, =2>>= adds error messages to the
end of the file and preserves any existing content.

If the file doesn't exist, it is created. If the file already exists,
the new error output is added to the end.

For example:

#+begin_src sh
$ cat nonexistent1 2>> errors.txt
$ cat nonexistent2 2>> errors.txt
$ cat errors.txt
cat: nonexistent1: No such file or directory
cat: nonexistent2: No such file or directory
#+end_src

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
$ ./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send a series of commands to your shell and append their
standard error to a file:

#+begin_src sh
$ ls nonexistent >> /tmp/foo/baz.md
ls: nonexistent: No such file or directory

$ ls nonexistent 2>> /tmp/foo/qux.md
$ cat /tmp/foo/qux.md
ls: nonexistent: No such file or directory

$ echo "James says Error" 2>> /tmp/foo/quz.md
James says Error

$ cat nonexistent 2>> /tmp/foo/quz.md
$ ls nonexistent 2>> /tmp/foo/quz.md
$ cat /tmp/foo/quz.md
cat: nonexistent: No such file or directory
ls: nonexistent: No such file or directory
#+end_src

The tester will verify that: - Commands with =2>>= append their standard
error to the specified file. - Existing file content is preserved (not
overwritten). - Standard output still appears on the terminal (not
redirected). - Files are created if they don't exist.
