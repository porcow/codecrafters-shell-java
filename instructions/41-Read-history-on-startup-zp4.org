In this stage, you'll ensure that your shell loads history from the file
into memory on startup.

*** The =HISTFILE= environment variable
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-histfile-environment-variable
:END:
The
[[https://www.gnu.org/software///bash/manual/bash.html#index-HISTFILE][=HISTFILE= environment variable]]
specifies the path to the history file. It is the path used to load
history from the file into memory on startup and to save the in-memory
history to the file when exiting.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will write the following commands to the history file:

#+begin_src txt
echo hello
echo world
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src

The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
HISTFILE=<path_to_history_file> ./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send the following commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ history
    1  echo hello
    2  echo world
    3 history
$
#+end_src
