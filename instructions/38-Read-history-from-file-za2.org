In this stage, you will read history from a file using the
=history -r <path_to_history_file>= command.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will write the following commands to the history file:

#+begin_src txt
echo hello
echo world
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src

The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send the following commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ history -r <path_to_history_file>
$ history
    1  history -r <path_to_history_file>
    2  echo hello
    3  echo world
    4  history
$
#+end_src

*** Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes
:END:
- The tester will expect the history commands to also be present in the
  history list.
- =history -r= should append the history file's contents to the history
  list in memory.
