In this stage, you'll implement support for pipelines involving more
than two commands.

Pipelines can chain multiple commands together, connecting the output of
each command to the input of the next one.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It'll then send commands involving pipelines with three or more stages:

#+begin_src sh
$ cat /tmp/foo/file | head -n 3 | wc
       3       3      10
$ ls -la /tmp/foo | tail -n 5 | head -n 3 | grep "file"
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user     5 Apr 29 10:06 file
$
#+end_src

The tester will check if the final output matches the expected output
after the multi-stage pipeline execution.

*** Notes

- This requires managing multiple pipes and processes.
- Ensure correct setup of stdin/stdout for each command in the chain
  (except the first command's stdin and the last command's stdout, which
  usually connect to the terminal or file redirections).
- Proper process cleanup and waiting are crucial.
