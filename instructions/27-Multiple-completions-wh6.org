In this stage, you'll implement tab completion for multiple executables
that share a common prefix.

*** Handling Multiple Matches
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: handling-multiple-matches
:END:
When a user types a command prefix and presses =<TAB>=, your shell
should find all executables in PATH that match the prefix and do the
following:

1. On the first =<TAB>= press, ring the bell (using =\x07=).
2. On the second =<TAB>= press:
   - Print all matching executables on a new line. List them in
     *alphabetical order*, separated by two spaces ( ).
   - Show the prompt again on the next line, keeping the original
     command prefix.

For example:

#+begin_src sh
$ xyz_<TAB><TAB>
xyz_bar  xyz_baz  xyz_quz
$ xyz_
#+end_src

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then set up a specific =PATH= and place multiple executables
starting with a common prefix into different directories in the =PATH=.

Finally, it will type the common prefix, and then press the tab key
twice.

#+begin_src sh
$ xyz_<TAB><TAB>
xyz_bar  xyz_baz  xyz_quz
$ xyz_
#+end_src

The tester will verify that: 1. The first tab press rings the bell. 2.
The second tab press displays all matching executables in alphabetical
order. - The matches are separated by two spaces. - The matches are
displayed on a new line. 3. The prompt reappears with the original input
preserved.
