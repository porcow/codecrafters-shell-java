In this stage, you'll implement the =exit= builtin.

*** The =exit= Builtin
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-exit-builtin
:END:
The
[[https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#exit][=exit=]]
builtin is a special command that terminates the shell.

When your shell receives the =exit= command, it should terminate
immediately.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send an invalid command to your shell, followed by the
=exit= command:

#+begin_src sh
$ invalid_command_1
invalid_command_1: command not found
$ exit
#+end_src

The tester will verify that your shell terminates after receiving the
=exit= command.
