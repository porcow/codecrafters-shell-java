In this stage, you'll implement support for redirecting a command's
output to a file.

*** The =>= Operator
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-operator
:END:
The =>= operator redirects the standard output of a command to a file.
When you use =>=, the output that would normally appear on the terminal
is instead written to the specified file.

If the file doesn't exist, it is created. If the file already exists, it
is overwritten (replacing its old contents).

For example:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello > output.txt
$ cat output.txt
hello
#+end_src

*** File Descriptor Notation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: file-descriptor-notation
:END:
In Unix, standard output is identified by the number =1=. You can
explicitly write =1>= to redirect standard output:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello 1> file.txt
#+end_src

However, since redirecting standard output is so common, the shell
allows you to omit the =1= and just write =>=:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello > file.txt
#+end_src

Both commands do exactly the same thing.

*** Error Output Is Not Redirected
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: error-output-is-not-redirected
:END:
The =>= operator only redirects standard output, not standard error. If
a command produces error messages, they still appear on the terminal:

#+begin_src sh
$ cat nonexistent > output.txt
cat: nonexistent: No such file or directory
$ cat output.txt
$ 
#+end_src

The error message appears on the terminal, and =output.txt= is empty (or
contains only the non-error output if there was any).

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
$ ./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send a series of commands to your shell and redirect their
output to a file:

#+begin_src sh
$ ls /tmp/baz > /tmp/foo/baz.md
$ cat /tmp/foo/baz.md
apple
blueberry

$ echo 'Hello James' 1> /tmp/foo/foo.md
$ cat /tmp/foo/foo.md
Hello James

$ cat /tmp/baz/blueberry nonexistent 1> /tmp/foo/quz.md
cat: nonexistent: No such file or directory
$ cat /tmp/foo/quz.md
blueberry
#+end_src

The tester will verify that: - Commands with =>= redirect their standard
output to the specified file. - Commands with =1>= work identically to
=>=. - Files are created if they don't exist. - Error messages still
appear on the terminal (not redirected). - Only standard output is
written to the file.
