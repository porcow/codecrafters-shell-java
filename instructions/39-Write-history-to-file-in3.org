In this stage, you will add support for writing commands from memory to
the history file using the =history -w <path_to_history_file>= command.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send the following commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello
hello
$ echo world
world
$ history -w <path_to_history_file>
$
#+end_src

The tester will then expect the history file's contents to look like:

#+begin_src txt
echo hello
echo world
history -w <path_to_history_file>
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src

*** Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes
:END:
- If the file doesn't exist when running =history -w=, your shell should
  create the file and then write the commands to it.
- The tester will expect the =history -w= command to also be present in
  the history file.
- The history file should include a trailing newline character
  (displayed as an empty line).
