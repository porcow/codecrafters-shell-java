In this stage, you'll add support for writing the in-memory history to
the history file when exiting.

The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
HISTFILE=<path_to_history_file> ./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send the following commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello
hello
$ echo world
world
$ exit
#+end_src

The tester will then expect the history file's contents to look like:

#+begin_src txt
echo hello
echo world
exit
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src
