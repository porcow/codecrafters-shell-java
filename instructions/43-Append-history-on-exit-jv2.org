In this stage, you'll add support for appending the in-memory history to
the history file when exiting.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will write the following commands to the history file:

#+begin_src txt
echo initial_command_1
echo initial_command_2
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src

The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
HISTFILE=<path_to_history_file> ./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send the following commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo new_command
new_command
$ exit
#+end_src

The tester will then expect the history file's contents to look like:

#+begin_src txt
echo initial_command_1
echo initial_command_2
echo new_command
exit
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src
