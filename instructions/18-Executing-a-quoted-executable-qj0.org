In this stage, you'll implement support for executing a quoted
executable.

*** Quoted Executable Names
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: quoted-executable-names
:END:
Up until now, the executable name (the first word in a command) has been
a simple string. But executable names can also be quoted, just like
arguments. This is useful when an executable has spaces, quotes, or
special characters in its name.

Quoting the executable name lets you execute programs that would
otherwise be difficult to reference.

For example:

#+begin_src sh
$ 'my program' argument1
# Runs an executable named "my program"

$ "exe with spaces" file.txt
# Runs an executable named "exe with spaces"
#+end_src

When your shell receives a command with a quoted executable:

- Your parser must correctly interpret the quotes to form the executable
  name (e.g., from ="my 'program'"= to =my 'program'=).
- Your shell must search for the unquoted program name in the =PATH=
  directories.
- Upon finding the executable, your shell must spawn the process and
  pass any other tokens as arguments.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send a series of commands to your shell, executing the
renamed =cat= executable:

#+begin_src sh
$ 'exe with "quotes"' file
content1
$ "exe with 'single quotes'" file
content2
#+end_src

The tester will verify that: - Quoted executable names are correctly
processed (quotes removed). - The resulting executable name is found and
executed. - The output matches what the executable produces.
