In this stage, you'll extend autocompletion to handle partial
completions using the longest common prefix (LCP) logic.

*** Completing to Longest Common Prefix
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: completing-to-longest-common-prefix
:END:
When multiple executables match the user's input, and some are prefixes
of others, your shell should complete to the longest common prefix of
all matches.

For example, if these executables exist in PATH:

- =xyz_foo=
- =xyz_foo_bar=
- =xyz_foo_bar_baz=

When the user types =xyz_= and presses tab, the shell completes to
=xyz_foo= because that is the longest prefix shared by all three
executables.

After the user types the next separator character, pressing tab
completes to the next common prefix of the remaining matches:

#+begin_src sh
# Note: The prompt lines below are displayed on the same line
$ xyz_<TAB>
$ xyz_foo_<TAB>
$ xyz_foo_bar_<TAB>
$ xyz_foo_bar_baz 
#+end_src

If there is only one match after performing completion, then the shell
should complete the command name as with previous stages (with a
trailing space).

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then test progressive tab completion:

#+begin_src sh
# Note: The prompt lines below are displayed on the same line
$ xyz_<TAB>
$ xyz_foo_<TAB>
$ xyz_foo_bar_<TAB>
$ xyz_foo_bar_baz 
#+end_src

The tester will verify that: 1. After =xyz_=, the completion shows
=xyz_foo=. 2. After typing =_= and pressing tab, the completion shows
=xyz_foo_bar=. 3. After typing =_= and pressing tab again, the
completion shows =xyz_foo_bar_baz= with a trailing space. 4. The
trailing space only appears when exactly one match remains.
