In this stage, you'll implement the =echo= builtin.

*** The =echo= Builtin
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-echo-builtin
:END:
The
[[https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html][=echo=]]
builtin prints its arguments to stdout, with spaces between them, and a
newline (=\n=) at the end.

Example usage:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello world
hello world
$ echo one two three
one two three
#+end_src

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send a series of =echo= commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello world
hello world
$ echo pineapple strawberry
pineapple strawberry
$
#+end_src

After each command, the tester will verify that the =echo= command
correctly prints the provided text back.

*** Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes
:END:
- Most languages' standard output functions like =console.log()=
  (JavaScript), =print()= (Python), or =println()= (Java) automatically
  add a newline, which is what you want here. If your language requires
  explicit newlines (like C's =printf()=), make sure to add =\n= at the
  end.
