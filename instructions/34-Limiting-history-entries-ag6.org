In this stage, you'll add support for limiting history entries using the
=history <n>= syntax.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send multiple commands to your shell, followed by the
=history <n>= command:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello
hello
$ echo world
world
$ invalid_command
invalid_command: command not found
$ history 2
    3  invalid_command
    4  history 2
$
#+end_src

The tester expects the history list to be limited to the last =n=
commands.

*** Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes
:END:
- The tester expects the history command to be present in the history
  list.
