In this stage, you'll refine your shell's tab completion behavior to
handle cases where the user types an invalid command.

*** Handling Invalid Completions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: handling-invalid-completions
:END:
When the user types a command that doesn't match any known builtin and
presses =<TAB>=, your shell should:

1. Leave the input unchanged (don't modify what the user typed)
2. Ring a bell to indicate there are no valid completions

The bell is produced by printing the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character][bell character]] =\x07=
to the terminal. This typically produces an audible beep or visual
flash, depending on the terminal settings.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

The tests will simulate the user typing an invalid command and pressing
the =<TAB>= key:

#+begin_src sh
$ xyz<TAB>
$ xyz
#+end_src

The tester will verify that: - The input remains unchanged when no
completion is possible - The bell character is printed to indicate no
matches
