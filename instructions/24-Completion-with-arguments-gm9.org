In this stage, you'll extend your shell's tab completion to handle
commands with arguments.

*** Tab Completion with Arguments
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tab-completion-with-arguments
:END:
In previous stages, you implemented basic tab completion for builtin
commands. Now, you'll ensure that after a command is completed, the user
can continue typing arguments and execute a full command.

For example:

#+begin_src sh
```bash
# 1. User types partial command
$ ech

# 2. User presses <TAB>. Shell autocompletes (note the trailing space)
$ echo 

# 3. User types argument 'hello'
$ echo hello

# 4. User presses <ENTER>. Shell executes the command
hello
#+end_src

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

The tests will simulate user input with tab presses and will execute
builtin commands, similar to previous stages, with added arguments:

#+begin_src sh
$ ech<TAB>
$ echo 
$ echo hello<ENTER>
hello

$ ech<TAB>
$ echo
$ echo foo bar<ENTER>
foo bar
#+end_src

The tester will verify that: - Tab completion works correctly. -
Arguments typed after completion are preserved. - The complete command
executes correctly with all arguments.
