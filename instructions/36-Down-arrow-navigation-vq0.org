In this stage, you'll add support for recalling history with the down
arrow key.

The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send multiple commands to your shell, followed by the up
and then down arrow keys to recall the history:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello
hello
$ echo world
world
<UP ARROW>
$ echo world
<UP ARROW>
$ echo hello
<DOWN ARROW>
$ echo world
#+end_src

The tester will expect the previous commands to be displayed when the
down arrow key is pressed.

- We recommend using a library like
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline][readline]] for your
  implementation. Most modern shells and REPLs (like the Python REPL)
  use readline under the hood. While you may need to override some of
  its default behaviors, it's typically less work than starting from
  scratch.
