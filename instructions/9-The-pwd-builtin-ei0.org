In this stage, you'll implement the =pwd= builtin.

*** The =pwd= Builtin
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-pwd-builtin
:END:
The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd][=pwd=]] (print working
directory) builtin prints the full, absolute path of the current working
directory to stdout.

When your shell starts, its current working directory is typically the
directory from which it was executed. Your =pwd= implementation needs to
retrieve this information from the operating system and print it.

For example:

#+begin_src sh
$ pwd
/home/user/projects
$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
#+end_src

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send a =pwd= command to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ pwd
/path/to/current/directory
$
#+end_src

The tester will verify that the =pwd= command correctly displays the
current working directory.

*** Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes
:END:
- The =pwd= command must print the full absolute path of the current
  working directory.
