In this stage, you'll implement support for being able to press enter to
execute a command recalled using UP-DOWN arrows.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send multiple commands to your shell, followed by the up
and then down arrow keys to recall the history and then press enter to
execute the command:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo hello
hello
$ echo world
world
<UP ARROW>
$ echo world
<UP ARROW>
$ echo hello
<DOWN ARROW>
$ echo world
<ENTER>
world
$
#+end_src

The tester will expect the command to be executed when the enter key is
pressed.
