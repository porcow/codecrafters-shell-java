In this stage, you will add support for appending commands from memory
to the history file using the =history -a <path_to_history_file>=
command.

*** Tests
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tests
:END:
The tester will write the following commands to the history file:

#+begin_src txt
echo initial_command_1
echo initial_command_2
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src

The tester will execute your program like this:

#+begin_src sh
./your_program.sh
#+end_src

It will then send the following commands to your shell:

#+begin_src sh
$ echo new_command
new_command
$ history -a <path_to_history_file>
$
#+end_src

The tester will then expect the history file's contents to include the
new commands:

#+begin_src txt
echo initial_command_1
echo initial_command_2
echo new_command
history -a <path_to_history_file>
<|EMPTY LINE|>
#+end_src

*** Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes
:END:
- The tester will expect the =history -a= command to also be present in
  the history file.
- Running =history -a= multiple times should only append commands that
  have been executed since the last time =history -a= was run.
